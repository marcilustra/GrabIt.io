# ImageSnatch
This is a small Python script to automate image reference gathering from Online Galleries. Personal use. Might make it in other languages.
Uses, BeautifulSoup4 to achieve the desired effect.

## Problem.
Trying to get multiple images from a gallery page without having to open a new tab and right-click -> Save Image for each file.

## How it addresses problem.
Python being an interpreted language allows you to modify the code to suit your needs. Thus the script provided will work for .jpg file links.
  - The soupit.py script saves (to a txt file) links from a page that contain the .jpg links
